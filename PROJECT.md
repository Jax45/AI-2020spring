# Project Objectives
1. Develop a logistic regression model (for classification) or linear regression model (for regression) for a pre-cleaned tabular dataset with at least a 1000 rows and at least 3 input features (columns) using Tensorflow.
1. Implement a Python function that serves as the model.
1. Entend the model to investigate the performance of various feedforward neural network architectures.
1. Study, investigate and discuss "what", "how", and "why" your model makes predictions.

# Project Expectations
1. You will work on your projects individually (i.e. group submissions are not allowed).
1. All reports including the final report must be prepared using <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>.
1. Each of you will review at least two reports of the peers in your group.

# Project Phases

## Data analysis & preparation
1. Description of the dataset, its source, and motivation for the project
1. Visualize/Plot the distribution of each input features and discuss the range of the values (min, max, mean, median, etc.)
   - For example, plot histograms showing distribution of each input features
1. Study the distribution of the output labels
    - In case of classification, check if the data is imbalanced
    - In case of regression, check if the values are uniformly distributed or not
1. Data normalization
1. Data spliting into training, and validation sets

## Model selection & evaluation
1. Compare the results of the neural network with a linear regression or logistic regression model
    - Start with a basic model and then grow your model into a multi-layered model
    - Discuss how neural network models will be selected
    - Document your performance comparison
1. Study performance difference when linear activation is used instead of sigmoid (and vice versa)
   - How does your performance change when linear activations are used instead of sigmoid, in the last neuron and all other neurons?
1. Evaluate your predictions (using Precision, Recall, MAE, MSE, etc.)
1. Code a function that represents your model
   - After your model is trained, read all the weights, and build your own function/method that serves as the model
   - Verify that predictions you obtain are same as the one you obtained using your trained model

## Feature importance and reduction
1. Study feature importance
1. Reduce input features

## Address peer-review comments

## Poster presentation
* Prepare a poster highlighting the problem, diagrams, your results, plots, etc.
* Bring a printed copy of your final report and your poster to the final exam
* Poster and final report will be evaluated based on all the criteria above.
* Report and poster presentation grades will be average of (a) grades by the course instructor (b) peer grades, and (c) grades by external visitor/s from industry
