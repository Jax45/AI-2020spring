## Course schedule

* Course schedule at [gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ptg43VLyei4-31yoKsPjQmOK-wa2zoccSDa-9uUY1Vs/edit?usp=sharing)

## General policies
* Keep yourself out of plagarism; Read [UMSL's Policy](https://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/policy/academic-dishonesty.html); Our `turnitin` tool automatically checks for plagarism
  <img src="supporting_files/turn-it-in.png" align="middle" width="200" border="2"/>  
* Lecture recordings, audio or video, are not permitted
* You are welcome to bring your laptop in class

## Programming language
* Python3 is language for the course; you are expected to use Python3 for all of your classroom activities, homeworks, and project.
* You are also required to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or your own hosted Jupyter Notebook for running your programs.

## Late policy  
* You have a total of 5 late days.
* Once you use your late days, late submissions will get no points.

## Course project
See [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md).

## Homeworks
Besides the main course project milestones, there will be no other homeworks.

## Tests 
* There will be short tests almost every week on Wednesdays (see the course schedule).
* If you miss a test (on topic A) and send me an email by the end of next day with a valid reason, your score in the next test (on topic B) will be copied as your score for the test you missed. However, in the test that you appear, you may be asked questions from both topics (A and B) while all others will receive questions only on topic B.
* Tests will be CLOSED book, CLOSED notes, and CLOSED electronics.
* Use of any type of electronics is strictly forbidden during tests.

## Attendance  
* Attendance will be recorded frequently
* More than 5 uninformed absenses may lead to failing the course

## Grade composition  
* 10 * 4 points = 10 Tests
* 20 * 1 points = 20 Activities
* 40     points = Project
* 1 bonus point to everyone in the class if 80%+ complete the course evaluation survey

#### Project (40 points)
* 10  points = Data analysis & preparation
* 10  points = Model selection & evaluation
* 5  points = Feature importance and reduction
* 5  points = Addressing peer-reviews
* 10 points = Poster presentation (score from external judges, peers, and instructor)
